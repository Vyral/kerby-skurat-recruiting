This team of experts is a big joy-giver for Kerby and Cristina, and each opportunity they have to help another person on the team thrive helps them know they are fulfilling their mission.

### Their Strategy

Kerby and Cristina always have their clients’ best interests at heart. In fact, they have been known to talk sellers out of putting homes on the market on occasion when it doesn’t make financial sense for the seller, encouraging them to explore renting it out to hold as an investment. Their commitment is to educate and provide unbiased advice when asked, as their goal is to gain a lifetime clients and referrals.

Bringing the “A game” starts with them, and they are committed to that each and every day.

### Growth and Big Picture

Kerby and Cristina agree on one indisputable fact, they love their team and attribute their overall success to the bonds that have formed within their work family.

Kerby and Cristina are quick to note that while they are honored to share company with only a few other teams in the country with similar award achievements, money isn’t everything. Success is measured by the clients who refer to you and reach out when they are ready to make a move. Their goal is to gain and retain lifetime clients who feel confident in reaching out to the team regardless of their situation – moving up or downsizing; selling or buying, anywhere in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul Metro area.

While work is undoubtedly an important part of their lives, they also continue to support missionaries and educators in other countries and would like to expand their offerings to include more international business training. In fact, Cristina has worked in D.R. Congo and has been involved in supporting smaller nonprofits that help women there become self-sustaining through small businesses. Her dream is to invest back in the infrastructure there to create jobs for the people there.
