First and foremost, if you’re a new agent with a limited budget, you want to invest in print marketing, making sure you go above and beyond by going bigger than the typical 8.5” x 11” brochure; an 11” x 17” brochure should be the baseline. **Print marketing helps the buyers remember your listing,** so you’ll want to have something more memorable than just your standard paper printout from the MLS.&nbsp;

At 1:00 in the video above, check out our luxury brochure example. It has a nice high-gloss layout displaying high-resolution photos. Brochures are definitely worth the investment.&nbsp;

Invest in a bigger yard sign—the bigger they are, the more memorable they’ll be, and the more memorable, the better. **Yard signs equal leads** from a buyer perspective, and if you have a visible number that directs straight to you or your team, it’ll help you sell that listing for more money; you’ll be able to respond faster to the buyer and get them into that house almost immediately.&nbsp;

The third component of this marketing equation is to **invest in your online leads.** We spend quite a bit of money on leads and generate over 1,000 leads every month, so it’s a great way for us to engage with more buyers and get them into our listings. You can get quite a lot of leads for a very low cost, which allows you to get into those important conversations with both the buyers who are ready to buy today and those who are eyeing a purchase in the next 12 to 24 months. You can nurture the latter leads and use them to build your pipeline.

As always, reach out if you have questions about anything covered in this video or real estate in general. We look forward to hearing from you, and stay tuned for more tips and insight\!
