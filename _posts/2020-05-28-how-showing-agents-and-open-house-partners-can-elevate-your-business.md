One of the things that a busy buyer’s agent has trouble doing is getting a lot of buyers out to homes on a consistent basis. Agents on our team are often very busy and not able to be with every single buyer or seller that is looking at properties.&nbsp;

**The way we help our agents is by having showing agents available to help them elevate their business** to be able to do the most dollar-producing activities such as negotiating contracts and meeting with new buyers or sellers.&nbsp;

Getting buyers out to look at homes is critical, and the showing agent allows you to be able to do that and also help other clients. **The best part is that your showing agent gets back to you right away so you can get back to the client right away with the information they need immediately.**

The showing agent model also helps give you a better work-life balance. We have agents who will go out of the country on vacation and still sell three to five homes in the week they’re gone because showing agents are out there taking care of their clients.

If you have any questions about showing agents, open house partners, or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
