Many agents have been asking us what the most crucial things are we can do for our clients during this challenging time so they can still make a move. The good news is, we’ve been doing this for years.&nbsp;

A great thing you can do for buyers is to make sure they’re comfortable with the virtual process. We’re doing virtual consultations, helping them understand the process, getting a home search set up, then doing either a virtual showing or walk-through. If they’re extremely interested in the home, then we’ll conduct a safe, in-person showing of the house with all health precautions in place.

For sellers, we’re doing virtual consultations and walk-throughs of their property. We’re reviewing our marketing strategy to ensure their home stands out from the competition, and that we find the right buyers. **We’re making sure this is an easy and safe experience for them.**

If you want to learn more about how we help our clients during this pandemic, or you have any questions, reach out to me via phone or email at cristina@kerbyandcristina.com. There are many more ways we’re helping our clients right now, and we would love to discuss them with you.
