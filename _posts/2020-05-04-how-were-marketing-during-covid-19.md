How are we currently conducting our marketing to continue to bring in buyers and sellers? Lately, **we’ve shifted away from a lot of mass media and are focusing on digital marketing.** We’re also retargeting old leads and trying to get them back to our website. That’s allowing them to have an agent to reach out to and connect with, get set up with a custom home search, view virtual tours, and more. We’re using these opportunities to convert them into clients with showing appointments or virtual buyer consultations.&nbsp;

All these things are giving us a competitive edge in this market. Since we have such an extensive and wonderful staff, we’re able to leverage that talent and expertise at a high level. Marketing correctly for the times and market you’re in can make a real difference.

If you have any questions about our marketing or real estate in general, please reach out to us via phone or email. We would love to help you.
