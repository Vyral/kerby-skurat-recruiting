<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>I understand that you may be working at a real estate brokerage as a solo agent or a member of another real estate team who promised you leads, support, and training but fail to provide you with all three. You understand your potential and are working hard to clear a path toward your goals, but currently lack the support you need to achieve them. </p>

<p>Many brokerages promise to provide leads, structure, coaching, and other resources but fail to make good on their word once they’ve drawn you in. As a result, 87% of all new agents fail within five years of working in the industry. In Minnesota, the average Realtor only sells three to four homes per year.</p>

<p>The reason so many agents drop out of the business is simple: They don’t know what they’re doing. This often isn’t their fault. It’s an unfortunate truth of our industry that the majority of brokerages or real estate teams out there don’t properly educate or equip their agents to make real estate a full-time career. You can’t make a living off of selling three homes per year.</p>

<p>Even the most hardworking agent won’t get anywhere if they aren’t headed in the right direction and don’t have the right support.</p>

<p>It’s time to stop chasing dead ends and operating blindly. It’s time to forge your own path to success.</p>

<p>We are the Kerby &amp; Cristina Real Estate Experts. My team has been around for over 12 years and we’ve sold over three thousand homes during that time. We have a team of real estate agents that are industry leaders that are constantly growing, and every single one of our agents has bought clients into our system. On our team, it’s impossible not to get help if you want it. Agents on our team sell 30 to 40 homes per year and make well over $100,000.</p>

<p>I’ve seen agents rack up tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt, waste time and money on useless activities, and lay awake at night wondering if entering the industry was a mistake—questioning whether they should just cut their losses and fall back into a regular 9-to-5 job. They’ve simply lost hope.</p>

<p>If this sounds familiar, then consider this message your lifeline.</p>

<p>We can provide the systems, training, accountability, and resources to help you achieve your goals. At the end of the day, nobody can do the work for you, but we can help make the work formulaic. If you show up and do what you’re supposed to do, you’ll be held accountable and be supported on your path to success with our team.</p>

<p>The majority of agents are not only wasting their time, but they’re also wasting their money and energy. Going to school, getting your license, and working hard just isn’t enough to make it.
What sets our team apart? For starters, our reputation. Everybody in the industry knows that we’re an honest, hard working team that does business with integrity. Other agents like to work with us because they know we get things done and don’t play games. Other teams promise leads and systems, but nobody has it down to a recipe as we do. Of course, we provide leads as well, but unlike other brokerages, we provide the training necessary to take those leads and convert them to actual business.</p>

<p>We allow our agents to focus on what they do best. They don’t have to worry about paperwork, showings, or marketing materials. All they have to worry about is serving their clients at the highest level. </p>

<p>Our systems truly work, but don’t just take my word for it. Consider the stories of Rachel, Allie, and Eric.</p>

<p>Rachel came from a corporate job where she was already making six figures but had little freedom. Making the jump to real estate full-time was scary for her, but we helped her transition while she worked both jobs to make it happen. When she eventually made the switch to real estate full-time, she ended up selling 44 homes in her first year and has full confidence about what she can do in the future.</p>

<p>Allie was serving tables and doing real estate on her own in her spare time without much success. She was selling about four to six homes per year. After joining us full-time and learning our training and our systems, she sold over 40 homes in her first year and 71 homes last year. </p>

<p>Eric was a past client and engineer who hated his 9-to-5 job. We recruited him as one of our first agents, gave him a lot of opportunities, and he eventually sold 69 homes in his strongest year with us and well over 200 homes in his career.</p>

<p>Their success stories are incredible, and now it’s time for you to start writing your own.</p>

<p>Here’s what I’m offering you today: I want you to schedule a meeting with me to talk about your career and where you want to be. If I miss the meeting, I’ll pay you $50 out of my own pocket. </p>

<p>After you join our team, we’ll get you on the ground rolling with our onboarding program. Right off the bat, you’ll be trained on our lead database, scripts and roleplay, and you can start getting your feet wet. We’ll get you shadowing our current agents, sales manager, and provide additional training at our team meetings and with our full-time on-staff trainer.</p>

<p>After all, the choice is in your hands. You can stay struggling where you are, join a big box brokerage where you’ll get no support, or even quit the industry altogether and go get started working at a 9-to-5 job—or you can join me and start leading the life you deserve.</p>

<p>Our support-oriented environment helps professionals learn, grow, and thrive. People join us because they want to succeed, make money, and serve our community. We understand that to reach those goals, you need support, coaching, resources, and leads—so that is exactly what we provide.</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? It’s time to take control of your future and see firsthand how joining us can transform your life and career. Why wait to make a change when you can make the one change necessary right now. The longer you wait to reach out, the longer you’re suppressing your true potential. Let’s have a conversation about your goals.</p>

<p>I look forward to talking to you soon!</p>

<p>Kerby Skurat and Cristina Edelstein-Skurat </p>
