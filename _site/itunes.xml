How are we currently conducting our marketing to continue to bring in buyers and sellers? Lately, we’ve shifted away from a lot of mass media and are focusing on digital marketing. We’re also retargeting old leads and trying to get them back to our website. That’s allowing them to have an agent to reach out to and connect with, get set up with a custom home search, view virtual tours, and more. We’re using these opportunities to convert them into clients with showing appointments or virtual buyer consultations. 

All these things are giving us a competitive edge in this market. Since we have such an extensive and wonderful staff, we’re able to leverage that talent and expertise at a high level. Marketing correctly for the times and market you’re in can make a real difference.

If you have any questions about our marketing or real estate in general, please reach out to us via phone or email. We would love to help you.

How do you get a seller to agree to a price reduction?

When we meet with sellers, we show them a circular pricing chart that you can see at 0:22 in the video above. The target price, or bullseye, is where you want to be because that will generate the most exposure for your home, attract the most offers, and capture the highest sale price. The bullseye is surrounded by three outer rings, each one representing a different degree of mispricing: 


  4% to 6% off: Showings but no offers
  6% to 12% off: Drive-bys only and a low number of showings
  +12% off: Drive-bys only 


So when you sit down with one of your sellers, show them this chart and explain to them that due to the market activity you’ve been observing, buyers’ response to their home, and conversations you’ve had with other agents, you believe their home is inside one of the mispriced rings. Then, advise them to allow you to make a market adjustment and reduce their home’s price. 

“The target price, or bullseye, is where you want to be.”

It’s important to be specific when reducing the price. Either give the seller a range to go by or name an exact number. There are two ways in which to give them clear direction. First, propose the reduction in writing and include all the market comps, research, and other data. Second, follow up with a phone call after your meeting, and make sure you schedule this call in advance. It usually helps them if they’ve had some time to think about what you discussed. 

If you’d like to talk more about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m here to help.

Many real estate agents have been asking us lately how they can stay in front of their clients during this pandemic. Staying in your client’s minds will help your business progress during this strange time. Here are two great ways to stay connected:

1. Make calls. Whether you use a phone or video calling platform, it’s necessary to stay in touch with your sphere of influence (friends and family who know you) and current and past clients. The more you stay in touch with those who already know how wonderful you are, the more referrals you’ll receive over time. An easy script is to simply say who you are and ask how they’re doing. State that the lockdown is really affecting us all, then ask how it’s specifically impacting them. ​​​​“Staying in your client’s minds will help your business progress during this strange time.”

2. Use your resources at a deeper level. We’re using tools we’ve had for a while, but we’re extending them further. There’s a blog we love called Keeping Current Matters; you should check it out if you’re interested. They have free online resources, and we’ve used a ton of their intel to help buyers and sellers understand what’s happening in the market so they can make informed decisions about their home purchase or sale. 

A lot of things have been changing due to the coronavirus, but you can still help people buy or sell real estate while staying safe.

If you have any questions about staying in touch with clients during COVID-19 or real estate in general, please call or email us. We look forward to helping you.
