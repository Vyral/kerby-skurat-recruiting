Many real estate agents have been asking us lately how they can stay in front of their clients during this pandemic. Staying in your client’s minds will help your business progress during this strange time. Here are two great ways to stay connected:

1. Make calls. Whether you use a phone or video calling platform, it’s necessary to stay in touch with your sphere of influence (friends and family who know you) and current and past clients. The more you stay in touch with those who already know how wonderful you are, the more referrals you’ll receive over time. An easy script is to simply say who you are and ask how they’re doing. State that the lockdown is really affecting us all, then ask how it’s specifically impacting them. ​​​​“Staying in your client’s minds will help your business progress during this strange time.”

2. Use your resources at a deeper level. We’re using tools we’ve had for a while, but we’re extending them further. There’s a blog we love called Keeping Current Matters; you should check it out if you’re interested. They have free online resources, and we’ve used a ton of their intel to help buyers and sellers understand what’s happening in the market so they can make informed decisions about their home purchase or sale. 

A lot of things have been changing due to the coronavirus, but you can still help people buy or sell real estate while staying safe.

If you have any questions about staying in touch with clients during COVID-19 or real estate in general, please call or email us. We look forward to helping you.
